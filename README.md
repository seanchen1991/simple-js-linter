# Simple JS Linter
An opinionated, lightweight, no-frills JS linter implemented in Rust.

As a first pass, this linter checks specifically for the following:

 - [] Checks for semicolons at the end of newlines.
 - [] Checks for proper spacing, i.e., space between `if` and the following
 parentheses.
 - [] Proper usage of `let` and `const` for variable declarations.
